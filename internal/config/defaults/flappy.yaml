physics:
  gravity: 0.20          # Downward acceleration per tick (lower = floatier)
  jump_impulse: -1.5     # Upward velocity on jump (negative = up)
  max_fall_speed: 0.5    # Terminal velocity
  base_speed: 0.5        # Pipe movement speed at easy difficulty

obstacles:

  pipe_spacing: 40       # Horizontal distance between pipes
  min_gap_size: 8        # Minimum gap to fly through

  top_margin: 3          # Minimum distance from top

difficulty:
  enabled: true          # Enable progressive difficulty (false = fixed)
